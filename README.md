# Exploratory Data Analysis

[![Open in MATLAB Online](readme/open-in-matlab-online.svg)](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=mathworks/exploratory-data-analysis&project=ExploratoryDataAnalysis.prj)

This repository contains notes and examples on exploratory data analysis from an internal MathWorks seminar series.

## Topics

* Principal component analysis
* Outlier analysis and anomaly detection
* Techniques for handling missing data
* Further linear methods for dimensionality reduction
* Multidimensional scaling and t-SNE
* Hierarchical clustering and MANOVA
* k-means and spectral clustering
* Probability distributions and Monte Carlo simulation

## Installation and Getting Started
The examples are provided in a MATLAB project.
1. Double-click on the project archive (`ExploratoryDataAnalysis.mlproj`) to extract it using MATLAB.
2. With MATLAB open, navigate to the newly-created project folder and double-click on the project file (`ExploratoryDataAnalysis.prj`) to open the project.
3. The example files are provided as Live Scripts (`Seminar01_PCA.m` etc) within the project.
